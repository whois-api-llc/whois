## Using the Whois API web service

[Whois API](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/whois-api-doc.php) provides domain
names'/IP addresses' well-parsed and accurate registration
details—also known as Whois Records—such as registrant names, emails,
addresses, registrar info, creation/expiration dates etc. for most of the
gTLDs and ccTLDs.

Here you'll find examples of querying the API implemented in multiple
languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/user/create.php) to
authenticate.

This API also supports
[API key authentication](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/user/management.php#api-key-management).

Please, refer to the
[Whois API User Guide](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/whois-api-guide.php) for
info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
